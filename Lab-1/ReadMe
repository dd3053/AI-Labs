1. Program Execution : 

(i) Run the command "make". It will create the required Class Files.
(ii) Execute : java Solution [-v] -start $start-node -goal $goal-node -alg [-depth] $depth $alg graph-file

Example : java Solution -v -start S -goal G -alg ID -depth 6 ./example.txt
Note : In the abopve command the example.txt file is in the same folder as Solution.java

2. Input Specifications : 
-v is an optional flag for verbose mode 
-start is followed by the name of the node to start from
-end is followed by the name of the node which is the goal
-alg is followed by one of: BFS, ID, ASTAR
-depth used only for iterative-deepening, that indicates the initial search depth, with a default increase of 1 after that.If entered in other Algorithm, the Error would be reported.
-a graph file 

-Iterative Deepening uses a Visited Set.
